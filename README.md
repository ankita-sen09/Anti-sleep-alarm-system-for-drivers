HI All this was my mini project for my 5th semester.This Project “ANTI-SLEEP ALARM FOR DRIVERS” is successfully designed, and
tested and demo unit is fabricated. The goal of this project is to develop a device that
can accurately detect sleepy driving and make alarms accordingly, which aims to
prevent the drivers from drowsy driving and create a safer driving environment. The
project was accomplished by an IR sensor. This system detects the drowsiness in
quickly. This system which can differentiate normal eye blink and drowsiness can
prevent the driver from entering the state of sleepiness while driving. Whenever a
driver asleep due to drowsiness, the buzzer continuously starts beeping unless the
driver gets back to his/her normal position.
